NYC-Restaurant-Ratings
This is an SQL project about NYC restaurant ratings.

The purpose of this project is to analyze a publically available dataset on NYC Open Data comprised of NYC restaurant ratings. The project seeks to understand themes as it relates to the distribution of restaurant ratings amongst the boroughs in New York City and various cuisine types. The project will use exploratory data analysis using SQL to find unique insights in the dataset. The dataset I am using for this project could be found here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j. The dataset contains nearly 215,000 records with many null values in each of its columns. For this analysis, I did not clean this dataset due to the multiple null values in each of the columns. It would eliminate the great insights of the dataset.

For the exploratory data analysis I wanted to find out the answers to several questions below to understand how New York City restaurants perform in their restaurant inspections. The questions and query inputs are below for each question. thE exploratory data analysis questions use uses time series analysis, case statements, partitions and rankings, and understanding the number of null values in the dataset.

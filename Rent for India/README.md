This is SQL code for descriptive analysis on house rent data in India.

This repository will store all of the SQL scripts used to perform descriptive analysis on the dataset. The dataset was found on Kaggle.com and was interesting to use and perform analysis on because of the variety of factors/categories I could use to analyze the dataset such as city, rent ($), posted dates, and much more.
